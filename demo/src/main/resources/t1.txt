Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased $474 million or 10% driven by Consumer subscription revenue, on a strong prior year comparable that benefited from transactional strength in Japan. Gross margin increased $6.5 billion or 18% driven by the change in estimated useful lives of our server and network equipment. \nOur competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers.\n# End of Report"
